# RLBlastWave

This is my implementation of the Retiere-Lisa Blast Wave model documented here: https://arxiv.org/abs/nucl-th/0312024

Additional info can be found here: https://www.star.bnl.gov/public/hbt/BlastWave/

"testMacro.cxx" is a ROOT macro I wrote to create and test the various functions necessary to produce the model. 
It should be usable as-is for anyone with ROOT, but in case there are problems, this macro was made using ROOT v6.24/02.
